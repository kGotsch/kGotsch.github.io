## WOD 1
It took me two attempts to complete WOD 1. I felt that the instructions were fairly clear and all of the steps followed the HTML concepts learned in the reading, so this WOD was not necessarily very difficult for me to complete (just a bit long). My first attempt was without the screen recording, as I wanted to try and see what problems I may encounter before actually recording the WOD. On both attempts I was in the SD time slot (the 2nd attempt I believe I was a little over 20 min), but I felt like I was just working a little slow. 
## WOD 2 
I felt that this WOD was the easiest to complete out of the three. I did take 2 attempts (the first one without recording), on the second attempt I completed the exercise in 8:44. The biggest challenge I encountered happened with the first attempt. I did forget that when using fonts like Oswald I needed to link the html page to Google API (which I figured out when rereading the reading when I was stuck). Besides that I feel this exercise helped me get familiar with using CSS. 
## WOD 3
This was the most challenging WOD out of the three (at least for me). This attempt did take me two attempts to complete, but on the first one I was DNF. I struggled to break the web page into three columns, after figuring out that (after watching the screencast) I had an issue where one column was higher than the rest (which then switched to being too low then the rest). The final challenge I encountered with this WOD was removing the bullets in the menu bar. I feel like this WOD took our reading and made us think about applying the knowledge without necessarily having the answer being obvious. I finished the 2nd attempt in 10:39.
## Overall
Overall, I felt that the WODâ€™s really helped me understand the concepts that we learned in class and the reading. If I had one advice, it would be to try at least one attempt without the recording (which we talked about in class after the WODs were due). This helped me become really familiar with what I needed to do, and gave me the opportunity to watch the screencast or go over the reading to solve any issues I was encountering.
