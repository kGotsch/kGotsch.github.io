Growing up, I always had a fascination for technology and computers. Some memories I have growing up involve going to see my Dad work when he was in the IT field. I remember thinking it was super cool when my Dad got to work in rooms that had giant machines (pretty sure that it was the server room, though I never asked him). I think that the combination of those experiences and then using computers, inspired me to want to eventually work in that field. 
Over the summer, I was offered an internship opportunity at the Bank of Hawaii as a Desktop Support Technician, which gave me a lot of experience in working on different technical issues. I definitely enjoyed the position as it taught me a lot about computers, but also showed me that there was still a lot more to learn.
In college, I started off as a computer science major, but there was a part of me that was also really interested in business. I learned about the MIS program through one of my coworkers who also attended UH Manoa (he majored in MIS). I felt that this major would be perfect for me as it would give me the knowledge I need for both business and computers.
