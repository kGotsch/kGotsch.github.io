Growing up, I always had a fascination for technology and computers. Some memories I have growing up involve going to see my Dad work when he was in the IT field. I remember thinking it was super cool when my Dad got to work in rooms that had giant machines (pretty sure that it was the server room, though I never asked him). I also remember that watching my Dad work was quite boring at times because we would be there for hours. 
Over the summer, I was offered an internship opportunity at the Bank of Hawaii as a Desktop Support Technician, which gave me some experience in working on different technical issues. I definitely enjoyed the position as it taught me a lot about computers, but also showed me that there was still a lot more to learn. 
I think that the combination of the memories with my Dad working and then actually having worked with computers myself, made me interested in pursuing this type of career and education.  
In college, I started off as a computer science major (at a different univerisity), but there was a part of me that was also really interested in business (and all the math requirements required for comp sci scared me). I learned about the MIS program through one of my coworkers who also attended UH Manoa and majored in MIS. After hearing about this major, I felt that this would probably be the best fit for me as it would give me the knowledge I need for both business and computers.
