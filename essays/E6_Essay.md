## 1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
My assignment is an ecommerce website that sells three different brands of vacuums (Shark, Dyson, and iRobot) with six different products each. 
## 2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
A good chunk of those unfortunately.  From Assignment 2 to Assignment 3, the validations that I implemented were not working properly (for the products page). Was able to maintain it for the login page, and the registration and account update pages are sort of working. Once the user signed in, I was not able to get the user to go back to their last page like I wanted, so I ended up just moving the user to the home page whenever they logged in. If they have items in the cart and they are logged in then it moves them to the invoice. Besides that the cart total does not update correctly and quantity available does not deduct properly (deducts after second attempt). . 
## 3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
I feel that I was able to implement sessions and cookies somewhat effectively. I feel that some functions (like logging the user off and completely wiping the users sessions and cookies) was working well. 
## 4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:
I wish that I was able to fix some errors that I encountered. I know that there were some errors that showed up in the console. Besides that, I do wish that the validations worked better. 
## 5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
A lot more design choices... It definitely got me to think about what I want to implement, why I want to implement, and how I was going to do it. It was a lot of fun to think about, but definitely difficult as I had to try and take what I had and make my design choices work. 
## 6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
I looked for solutions online, previous labs, and teh Assignment 3 example and solutions. A good example of this was that I was not able to get my cookie to display, but W3 schools offered an explanation for why I was not able to access stored cookies, and showed a function that would work. This helped me use the values that I had stored (and display/access it the I wanted). 
## 7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
The only things I can think of that I feel works well is the logging in (which creates a session and stores the users information as a cookie). I feel that the code is also able to send an email. 
## 8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
A lot of logic errors that causes a lot of problems. Besides that I feel like I was not able to get simple things to function as well as I would have liked. 
## 9. What did you learn from doing this assignment?
I learned how to effectively use cookies and sessions to store products and user information. Also learned the functionality of nodemailer, and how it is used. A lot of newer items that helped me see what current websites use and implement which was pretty cool.
## 10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
I would have liked to put in more time into Assignment 3. I understand why I was not able to put as much time into the Assignments as I would have liked, but if I could go back in time then I would have liked to try and put aside more time where I could have to work on this Assignment (maybe took a day off of work or something). Towards the end some things did not work, which freaked me out as I would have a working page and then change one thing and the whole site would not work. My mindset would go from "At least I have something I can at least turn in to "oh no, if I don't resolve this I I will not have a working site". Also, should have reached out and asked for help when I needed it. 
## 11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I feel that the breakdown for this Assignment would be 35% thinking about how to do something, 20% writing code, and 45% testing and debugging
## 12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
I did not work in a group for this assignment (so 100%).
