## 1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
My assignment is an ecommerce website that sells three different brands of vacuums (Shark, Dyson, and iRobot) with six different products each. 
## 2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
A good chunk of those unfortunately.  From Assignment 2 to Assignment 3, the validations that I implemented were not working properly (for the products page). Was able to maintain it for the login page, and registration and account update page are sort of working. I was not able to get the movements the way that I wanted, so I ended up just moving the user to the home page whenever they logged in. If they have items in the cart and they are logged in then it moves them to the invoice. Besides that the cart total does not update correctly and quantity available does not deduct properly (deducts after second attempt). . 
## 3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
Not really that much. Glad it is able to use sessions and cookies somewhat effectively. Wish that it was better then it is.
## 4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:
I wish that the things I implemented in previous Assignments carried over better, unfortuntately I did not effectivetely get it to implement
## 5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
A lot more design choices... It definitely got me to think about what I want to implement, why I want to implement, and how I was going to do it.
## 6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
I looked for solutions online. A good example of this was that I was not able to get my cookie to display, but W3 schools offered an explanation for why I was not able to access stored cookies, and showed a function that would work.
## 7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
Not really that much (at least when I am thinking about it now). At least it runs some what, and hopefully is enpough to make me fail. If you are looking for specifics then cookies and sessions. 
## 8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
A lot of logic errors that causes a lot of problems. Besides that I feel like I was not able to get simple things to function as well. Also, was not able to figure out why my invoice does not cleanly transfer when sending an email
## 9. What did you learn from doing this assignment?
I learned how to effectively use cookies and sessions (probably did not use them well myself), but definitely learned
## 10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
I understand why I was not able to put as much time into the Assignments and course work as I would have liked, but if I could go back in time then I would have liked to try and put aside more time where I could have to work on this Assignment. Towards the end more and more things did not work, also had an issue that made me start back to square one (which was really frustrating). I also should have asked for help when I needed it. 
## 11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I feel that the breakdown for this Assignment would be 35% thinking about how to do something, 20% writing code, and 45% testing and debugging
## 12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
I did not work in a group for this assignment (so 100%).
