## 1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
In Assignment 2, we took what we already made and added a login feature before taking the user to an invoice. The login was supposed to have certain acceptable characters/lengths/etc for the user to login. We made a JSON file and used that to match an account, save newly created accounts, and update account details.

## 2. What did you learn from this assignment?
Assignment 2 has taught me how to access and edit files, which was used to create a login profile (email and password). I feel that this assignment has taught me to troubleshoot more than Assignment 1 due to the many problems I encountered in this assignment over the previous one. 
## 3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
Worked on my own for Assignment 2. 
## 4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
When encountering an issue (or just needing help), I either asked friends or tried looking up my issues online. I also looked at other students codes when I got super  stuck to see what I could do to resolve those issues. For example, one area where I struggled was carrying over the quantity through multiple plages. 
## 5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
I feel that there was a lot more thinking involved with Assignment 2 then with Assignment 1. It was nice that all of the pages were created, and not a lot of code is involved to create a login page. Because of that a lot more thought was put into redirecting the user to the login page first (and giving them the option to create an account/change account details), and then validating that it matches the assignment requirements. 
## 6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
I probably spent around 25% thinking, and then 37.5% testing and debugging.
## 7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
I feel that validation from the server side worked well (for the most part) on the login page. When it came to creating a username, or updating an account, I had some issues where it would not match with an account  or delete an old account (to replace with new entered information). 
## 8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
If I could do things differently, I would try and dedicate more time to testing. I tested as I went along, but approaching the deadline I found more issues with my Assignment that I tried to fix. I would also have tried to understand how a query string works, as one issue that I encountered was keeping the data from the login page to the invoice (I would lose the quantity each time).
