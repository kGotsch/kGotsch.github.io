## 1. Provide a brief introduction to the WOD along with a link to this page for further details
The three WODs that were completed since the last essay were BrowserHistory6, SmartPhoneProducts1, and Invoice1. Here are the links to all three: 
https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/040.dynamic-web-pages/experience-browserhistory6.html
https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html
https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html
BrowserHistory6 involved getting a little more fancier with the WODs that were previously worked on. In this WOD, we also used onmouseclick  and onmouseover (I believe to display an image when hovering). SmartPhoneProducts1 was basically taking what we have worked on in labs and replacing any hard coded names, price, etc. with variables.  Invoice1 was setting up a bunch of equations, and then formatting rows of information in order to make it look like an invoice. 
## 2. Discuss your experiences in performing the WOD. What worked well, what did you stumble on or slowed you down.
Overall, I feel that my experience was fairly good with the WOD’s. I was able to understand what I needed to do to complete the steps. I feel that the instructions were really helpful in giving me hints on how to approach each step. I did encounter some problems. With BrowserHistory6, I struggled to get images of logos to display when my mouse was hovering over the tabs. I also struggled with invoice1 originally, as I had a hard time either figuring out the different quotations used ( “ ‘ `), and sometimes the code looked like a mess so I forgot closing tags, or to use a script. All of this definitely slowed down my time in trying to complete this exercise. 
## 3. Describe what you to did to prepare. What did you do similarly or differently from the WOD before this?
Similarly to the previous WOD’s, I prepared for these WOD’s by first going through the instructions to get a rough idea of what I was going to be doing. This helped me to look up any information from the readings that I felt like I was missing. I feel like what I also did that was similar to last time was going through thee WOD once without recording. This helped me identify any problems or mistakes that I may encounter during my actual recording. I found that  this also helped me cut down on time, as I got a good idea of what I had to do on my actual attempt. 
## 4. Discuss what you could have done to be better prepared and what you might try differently for the next WOD.
I feel that to better prepare for the WODs I could have done a better job going through the reading. There were times where I needed to go back to look at what methods (and anything else) that I needed to use. Also, I will try not to panic too much when things do not work right the first time, or if I end up with any errors. I feel like I get a little worried when things do not work right, and then I do not think through the problem as well as I should (which only adds more time to the WOD).
